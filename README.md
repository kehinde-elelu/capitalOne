# Capital One Project 

## Overview
This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks and files related to a project focused on analyzing capital one transactions data. 
The link to the dataset: https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS
The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, wrangling and modeling. Below is a brief description of the files and directories present:

## Files and Directories

- `01_main.ipynb`: 
This notebook serves as the main entry point for the project, I unzip and check column with null and empty strings.
Also saved as pickle for faster loading 
  
- `02_preprocessing.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to data preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning, transforming, statistical information and preparing the data for analysis.

- `03_plots.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for generating transactional plots based on the clean data.
Information about outliers was also visualize and hypothesis testing was done for distribution testing  

- `04_wrangling.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on data wrangling tasks, which may involve checking for reversal and multi-swipe transaction.

- `05_model.ipynb`: These notebooks pertain to modeling tasks, such as building machine learning models or statistical analyses.

- `utils.py`: This Python file contains utility functions or helper code used across the project.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw data or intermediate datasets used in the project.

- `venv/`: Directory containing a virtual environment for Python dependencies.

## Usage
To use this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can explore the notebooks in Jupyter environment.
